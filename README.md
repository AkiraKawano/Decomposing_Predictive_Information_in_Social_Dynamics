This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for estimating information-theoretic measures, including mutual information, transfer entropy, and partial information decomposition (PID).

As a demonstration, we analyze behavioral tracking data of zebrafish pairs engaged in dominance contests, presented in:
O’Shaughnessy, L., Izawa, T., Masai, I., Shaevitz, J.W., Stephens, G.J. (2024). Dynamics of Dominance in Interacting Zebrafish. PRX Life, 2, 043006.

We examine the dynamics of social interaction using a sliding time-window approach. Information measures are estimated under the Gaussian approximation of the underlying distributions. For further theoretical and computational details, please refer to:
